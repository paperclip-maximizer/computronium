Breath of the Wild and Zero Dawn
Chicago bricks, and Sydney
Pluto's Fire, Amnesia Haze
Jack's and a Medici

I saw a silvery rainbow stream pouring out from two sides of a titanic cloud
I happened to be at a coffee shop when I received a phone call from my mother and stepped outside to take it
She said she'd intended to call after work the day before (a rain check for the birthday call she'd missed), but fell asleep in her living room chair by the TV and didn't wake up until late into the night
Now, when she hadn't called by 6pm yesterday, I had decided to go to the very same cofee shop I was in today
I think it might have been the first time in about two years I had spontaneously gone out with the express hope of having a chance encounter with someone
And I had one with the barista
It was synchronistic enough that I had decided to go back and try again
The phone call only lasted a minute or two, and then I went back inside
A few moments later I turned around and the stream had already evaporated
