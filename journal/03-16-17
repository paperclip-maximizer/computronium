Day three at the coffee shop and, 
  with the help of a few green friends,
    (god, that's a fascinating thing to have come out of me just now,
      given the n entendre where n is >= 2 
        1. coffee with irish cream in anticipation of St. Patrick's Day & the reason I chose to be playfully vague
        2. the frog symbol
        3. ...?
    )
  I am once again having an experience worth talking about. 
This time it's a feeling of overwhelming clarity about the best path foward for my pet project.
  (hastily and probably incompletely documented in Evernote, 
    and hopefully sufficiently present in my memory that I've not lost it by pausing to describe the moment)
